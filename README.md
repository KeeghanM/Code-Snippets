# Code-Snippets
These are useful wee snippets of code in various languages that I have either written or modified.

Each folder represents a different language, and within them I have tried to group by the codes purpose.
Tags are used for credit where possible.

Branching will happen very rarely as updates to the code will normally not be offshoots, more commonly just fixes/improvements.

Stealing, re-writing, using in any form, or just generally perusing.. fully allowed and recommended
